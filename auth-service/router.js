 * Authorization Service

 * subsequent request should include the token in the
 * HTTP Authorization header.
 * 
 * Tokens expire 6 hours after creation. Once a token
 * has expired, login is required in order to re-authenticate.
 * CBI’s tokens allow for a single user to have multiple
 * active tokens on separate devices as well as the ability
 * for admin users to create tokens that do not expire.
 * 
 * For security reasons CBI will only expose the token once,
 * on login or on register, and never again. Be sure to
 * store it somewhere safe.
